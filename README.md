# EPS_model_and_data. 
These files contains the input model including conductivity models and source current models with various resolution, and the tidal-induced magnetic fields calculated. The data files include results at 200 km and 400 km orbit for M2 and O1. The model contains M2 current, O1 current and conductivity models. All resolutions for data and models are available. 
The 0.1 degrees resolution results is too large to upload. If necessary, please contact through gycsu2021@csu.edu.cn.
